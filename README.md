## Proptracker is a simple table that keeps track of NounsDAO proposals

This is a React.js project I created for fun, in order to get better at coding and to create a tool that I thought could benefit NounsDAO.
It's probably not the most elegant piece of code ðŸ˜…

Full disclosure: I am not using a dynamic DB for this, but a simple .Json file for now.

If you have any suggestions on how to improve it, you can reach out to me on Twitter @coralorca. 

Thank you!
